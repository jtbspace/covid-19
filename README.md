# Covid-19 Tracker

This is a react based app which pulls data from an external API and displays the results with some extra calculations.

This is only the compressed version of the website, as it hosted on github pages. https://jtbspace.github.io/covid-19/


++ There are some bugs with the sadning numbers of people infected in India and USA. There is an issue with the calculation, due to the values being in the millions,thus there population will be NaN.
